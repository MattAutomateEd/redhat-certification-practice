# ðŸ§ª Ansible Lab â€“ Filtering Complex Data Structures

## Overview
This lab focuses on using advanced Jinja2 filters (`selectattr`, `map`, `select`) and lookup plugins to transform complex data into useful outputs.

It simulates a real-world scenario where:
- User records are provided via variables
- Department metadata is loaded externally
- Filters extract useful subsets of information

## Objectives
- Use `selectattr` to filter users and departments by attributes
- Use `map` to extract emails or usernames
- Load external data using `lookup('file') | from_yaml`
- Practice manipulating structured nested data

## Tasks Summary

```
ðŸ“˜ Tasks in playbook.yml
Each of the following tasks is defined as a prompt inside the playbook. Your job is to write the logic for each task using Ansible filters like selectattr, select, and map.

âœ… Task 1 â€“ Select Only Active Users
From the users list (loaded from vars/user_data.yml), filter only the users where active is set to true.
Save the result in a variable called active_users.

âœ… Task 2 â€“ Extract Usernames of Active Users
Using the active_users list from Task 1, extract just the username field from each user.
Store this list as active_usernames.

âœ… Task 3 â€“ Select Users in Department "ops"
From the full users list, filter only the users where the department is equal to "ops".
Store this filtered list as ops_users.

âœ… Task 4 â€“ Map Email Addresses of Ops Users
Using the ops_users list from Task 3, extract each user's email address.
Store this list as ops_user_emails.

âœ… Task 5 â€“ Show Departments from External Data
Load department data using a lookup plugin from the file files/departments.yml.
Extract the name field from each department and display the result.

âœ… Task 6 â€“ Select Only Active Departments
From the loaded department data, filter only the departments where status is equal to "active".
Store this filtered list as active_depts.

âœ… Task 7 â€“ Show Department Heads of Active Departments
From the active_depts list created in Task 6, extract the head value of each department.
Display the final list of department heads.
